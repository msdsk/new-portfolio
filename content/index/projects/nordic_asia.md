Project for building a website for an investment fund that I joined (and soon after took reins of) after the first version was released. Based on Dato CMS and Gatsby.

I was tasked with gradual extending, rebuiolding and maintaining the site, with CSS/HTML refactoring taking a big part, as the first version was released as a rushed MVP. Within it I built an interactive chart using d3.js for data visualization.
