Project for building a website for an investment fund that I joined (and soon after took the reins of) after the first version was released. Based on Dato CMS and Gatsby (React).

I was tasked with gradually extending, rebuilding and maintaining the site, with CSS/HTML refactoring taking a big part, as the first version got released as a rushed MVP.
