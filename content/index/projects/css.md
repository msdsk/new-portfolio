How often have I had to copy-paste the same declarations into new projects? I can't remember. So, instead, I decided to create a neat, minimal, plug-and-play, highly customizable, no-bullshit-allowed CSS system as my bootstrap for all future projects (like this one).

I'm not great at remembering names and details, so I created a proper living documentation that lives within the CSS files as markdown-like comments that afterwards are rendered as [a visual guide](https://css-system-deploy.netlify.app/) with both code and usage examples.
