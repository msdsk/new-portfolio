How many times I had to copy-paste the same declarations into new projects? I can't remember. So, instead, I decided to create a neat, minimal, plug-and-play, highly customizable, no-bullshit-allowed CSS system as an own bootstrap for all future projects (like this one).

I'm not great at remembering names and details, so I made sure to create proper living documentation that lives within the css files in form of markdown-like comments that afterwards gets rendered as [a visual guide](https://css-system-deploy.netlify.app/) with both code and usage examples.
